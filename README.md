This repository simply contains custom Veewee definitions for use in building base Vagrant boxes. 

The tweaks found here that are not part of the default Veewee templates include:

* UK locale changes
* The latest version of Ruby and Ruby Gems
* The exclusion of Puppet for provisioning since we are a Chef workshop
